## Introduction

We have been exploring HTML and CSS, and now it's time to use those skills practically. In this exercise, you will create a portfolio showcasing your background, skills, and projects ‚Äì a gateway to displaying your journey into the tech world!

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. Fork this Repository.
2. Clone the Repository to your computer.
3. Make sure to structure your HTML file with appropriate elements.
4. Organize your CSS stylesheet for maintainability. Separate sections and comment as necessary.
5. Use ID and class selectors to apply CSS styles to elements on your webpage.
6. Develop each section described under "Deliverable" below.

## Instructions
No starter code provided. You will create a simple personal portfolio using HTML and CSS. The HTML file should link with the external CSS file.

## Deliverable
You should create the following sections on the page:

1. Header: It should include your name and a brief tagline or title such as "Portfolio," "Web Developer," etc.
2. About me: Write a brief introduction about yourself. It should include your career goal or aspiration in web development.
3. Professional Background: Highlight your previous career experience. This could include key responsibilities or projects, the skills you used, and how these experiences help you as a developer.
4. Skills: List the programming skills (e.g., HTML, CSS) you have. You can present this in a neat list format, or use CSS to style it to seem like a progress bar. Also include your soft skills that you've build throughout your career in a separate section.
5. Projects: A section for the projects you've completed or are working on.
6. Contact Me: Include information on how people can reach you (you can use dummy contact info for now if you prefer to keep your privacy while practicing).
7. Footer: This could include copyright information, date, and any other links or small bits of info you'd like to include.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "initial portfolio website"
git push origin main
```

Create a Pull Request and submit the Link to your Pull Request in the LMS. 

## Bonus
If you still have time and the energy, let's bring your portfolio to the (public!) world.

We encourage you to use GitHub Pages.

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. It's a great way to host your personal pages directly from a GitHub repository.

[To get startet follow the instructions here.](https://pages.github.com/)

If you've followed the instructions, it may take a couple of minutes before your personal website is up and running - be patient. 

See your Website? Congratulations! üëè

You officially created your first piece of art in the world wide web. 

If you went the extra mile, feel free to submit your public GitHub Pages link instead of the Pull Request.

<summary>Feeling Stuck? Can't figure out where to start or solve a problem?</summary>

No worries - we all get there. Start with the basics - write the foundational HTML structure for your website. With that down, start adding some style - color, fonts, layout tweaks - using CSS.

<summary>Want to make a section stand out more? What about styles?</summary>

Absolutely! Sprinkle in some CSS magic! By experimenting with different fonts, colors, and backgrounds, you can make any section 'pop'.

<summary>Center-aligning your text giving you trouble?</summary>

Just an easy CSS property can help! Try Ôªøtext-align: center; - and voila, your text is right in the middle.

<summary>Having a hard time centering a block element?</summary>

A common stumbling block. A combination of `margin: auto;` and a specified `width` ought to do the trick in your CSS.

<summary>Images not sitting in the center?</summary>

Images obey the same CSS rules as other elements! Setting Ôªødisplay: block; plus Ôªømargin: auto; will place your images neatly in the center.

<summary>Can't push changes to GitHub?</summary>

First things first, commit all the changes you want to push. If you're still facing issues, you might want to check if you have the right permissions for pushing to the repository.

Always keep in mind that no question is too small or insignificant - if it's blocking your progress, it's worth finding the answer.
